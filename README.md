# GoldPiglin
When you wear armor with gold patterns, the effect is the same as wearing gold armor.

This project is not completely finished yet, so there are usually some missing features.

## Support
All Bukkit servers from spigot onwards.

such as: Spigot, Paper, Purpur, Folia...

I tested under 1.20, lower versions have not been tested, but it may work.

Versions 1.20.5 and newer are temporarily unavailable, I think that should be the case at the moment.

## License
Use [Apache-2.0](https://github.com/404Setup/GoldPiglin?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme) as the license.

If you publish my work elsewhere, you need my permission first and you must redirect the download source to my Modrinth, Hangar, Gitlab and Github pages and keep the original link. You cannot declare this project as yours.
